# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Txtzyme Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

We can read from and write to electrical circuits by running small Txtzyme programs on microcontrollers attached to federated wiki servers. This plugin extends the Txtzyme language with words for running programs and collecting results over dedicated socket connections.
